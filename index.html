                    Hi, Welcome to my humble website and thanks for checking this. I'm 23-y/o a Citizen Scientist 
                    looking forward to join some International Intergovernmental Organization as a Scientist/Engineer :)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm working as a Graduate Engineer Trainee in L&T Limited, and also as a Citizen Scientist at Zooniverse. Before joining L&T, I was a Summer Student at Dzhelepov Laboratory of Nuclear Problems in 
                        Joint Institute for Nuclear Research at Dubna, Moscow Region where I worked on project "Detector and Physics Simulation for the SPD Experiment". 
                        I've even completed a year long Research Internship from CSIR-CEERI and the project was on CO2 detection using NDIR Gas Sensor. Earlier this year, 
                        I completed another Research Internship from Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions, JINR,  
                        where I worked on a project related to production and spectroscopic investigation of Super Heavy Elements (SHE) at MASHA facility.
                         I was also interned at The Sparks Foundation, Singapore where I did projects related to web development & app development.
                          This was all about my technical experience hitherto. In non-technical domain, I worked as an intern under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, and also as a Pre-Sales intern for WhiteHat Jr.
                          I've also completed some Vocational Trainings like I worked as a summer trainee at Central Coalfields Limited, Ranchi, and
                            at West Central Railway, Jabalpur, where I was taught about various electronic instruments used by them during industrial work.
                             I'm also a great team leader, but able to work independent as well.
                            I have excellent communication skills both oral and written, and am a native Hindi speaker with proficiency in English as well. 
                    </p>

            
                    <p>
                    I am enthusiastic about the technology & loves to learn about the different kinds of gadgets being launched 
                    all the time. I usually tries to learn more from my seniors and professors about their ongoing projects and 
                    Research works. I've keen interests in Particle Physics, Nuclear Physics, Microelectronics, and Electronic Devices and is always curious to know more about them.  
                    Due to my strong adoration towards Particle Physics, I'm helping ATLAS scientists in their discovery of massive
                    long-lived particles, by classifying real events and data collected by ATLAS Detector during LHC Run II.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    You can find me using the contacts below, altough I'm likelier to be playing with the dogs
                    somewhere near the L&T guest house at Jodhpur, India.

Once the user is signed in, their name, email, and profile picture is displayed on the next screen. User can further continue to the next interface i.e. "Euro 2 INR Converter" page.<br>
