                    Hi, Welcome to my humble website and thanks for checking this. I'm 21-y/o biding my time in
                    Jabalpur before I come out and lead this world... :)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Being a nature lover boy who admires it from the bottom of my heart, I like all the animals as they
                    are the marvellous creations of the God. I love them more than I love myself and always tries to 
                    do something great for them. Yes I don't have any pet just only because of the reason I consider 
                    every street animals as my pet and cares for them on the basis of that perspective only. I have 
                    a deep appreciation for everything beautiful humans did and can create with their talent. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In my fun time I love to play Call Of Duty and am a big fan of it's protagonist Capt.Price. I've
                    completed all it's series and do let me know if there is something cool game you would like to 
                    share with me. Apart from these my heart beats for the South Indian dishes such as Mysore Masala Dosa,
                    Rava Idli and many more. Also my habit of learning capitals of all the countries is so superlative that
                    I doubt if anyone could defeat me in the trivia of "Capitals Of The World."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    I am enthusiastic about the technology & loves to learn about the different kinds of gadgets being launched 
                    all the time. I usually tries to learn more from my seniors and professors about their ongoing projects and 
                    Research works. I also have keen interests in electronic devices, smart sensors, and cloud computing and is always curious to know more about them.  
                    Apart from these I have a strong adoration towards space activities and Remote sensing of geographical areas.
